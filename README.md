## Instructions

On the sign in screen (sorry it needs a better method to do this), leaving the homeserver field empty will use matrix.org by default.

## Building

Currently to build Watch The Matrix, you will also need a local copy of [pixlwave/Matrix](https://github.com/pixlwave/Matrix) alongside this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/pixlwave/Matrix
git clone https://github.com/pixlwave/Watch-The-Matrix
cd Watch-The-Matrix
xed .
```
